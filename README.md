Serverless MySensors Controller on AWS

This project uses AWS to create a minimal Serverless controller for MySensors gateways.

The hope is that this will be easily maintaniable for educators and that the MySensors
projects are an easy way for students to start learning about IoT. This is not designed
to be a commercial hardened IoT platform.
